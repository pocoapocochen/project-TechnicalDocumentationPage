* Project topic from: freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Course
* [Live](https://pocoapocochen.github.io/project-TechnicalDocumentationPage/) version

## User Story
* I can see a navbar and the page's main content (technical documentation).
* When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section.
* On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the navbar should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible.

* HTML
* CSS (layout: fix / relative / absolute position)
* Font Awesome
